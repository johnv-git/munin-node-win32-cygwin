Cygwin x86-64 does not have perl-libwin32 ported and thus many of the plugins
will not work.  Until this is ported, use Cygwin x86-32.

Note that when fetching Win32_PerfRawData_PerfOS_Processor, the property
PercentProcessorTime is the same as PercentIdleTime.  This must be a bug.
To get the actual processor time, use 1-PercentProcessorTime
